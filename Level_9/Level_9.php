                PHP File that calculates the distance from the current location to a property
            </a>
            <p>
                The PHP file utilises Level 7 and Geolocation to work out the distance
                from each property's address to the user's current location.
                Google APIs are used alongside the browser geolocation API.
                The distance column in the table is generated after the XHR request and XSL processing.
